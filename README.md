- 4 Mortors and tires
- 3 IR Sensor or 2 IR Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Motor Driver
- Male to Male Jumpers
- Male to Female Jumpers
- Female to Female Jumpers

###### Features of the robot

•	Identifying a black line and following it.

•	Detecting an object on the line between 0-20 cm and avoid it. Then again come to the line and follow the black line.

•	Identifying four way junctions.

•	If there is an object in front of the four way junction between 30 – 70 cm. Robot will detect it and turn into the right side.

•	If there is an object on the end of the right side between 20 – 30 cm line it will turn around and come back towards four way junction.

•	Then it will go to the left side of the four way junction. If there is an object at the end of the left side line 20 – 30 cm it will turn around and come back towards four way junction.

•	Next it will go to the straightway of the four way junction. Again if there is an object at the end of the straight line 20 – 30 cm it will turn around and come back towards four way junction.

•	Otherwise robot will stop if there is an object detected above 70 cm at the end of the line.
